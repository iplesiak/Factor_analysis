# Factor_analysis
What are the factors that can be derived from the many lifestyle and sustainable clothing perception variables?
Are respondents purchase intentions and willingness to recommend sustainable clothing the same across education level categories?
What are the most important drivers of purchase intentions and willingness to recommend sustainable clothing?
Are the effects of the most important drivers of purchase intention and willingness to recommend sustainable clothing constant across types of respondents, or do they systematically vary, and if so, how?


4 factors were identified regarding the lifestyle questions:“Shopaholic” (intensive shopper), “Taste” (fashion sense), 
“Status” (interested in luxury/prestige) and “Functionality” (caring about the purpose).
For perception 3 factors was recognized: “Awareness” (informed about sustainability), “Ignorance” (lacking responsibility/interest about sustainability) 
and “Willingness to buy” (investing ability and will to buy sustainable clothes). It was not found any differences across education levels for 
purchase intention and willingness to recommend, except when the purchase intention is affected by purchase frequency.
The most important drivers of the purchase intention to buy sustainable clothing are status and the gender female. For willingness to 
recommend sustainable clothing status is the most significant driver. Looking at the amount of money a customer spent on clothes in 
general, no change in the effect of status on purchase intention was observed.
The effect of status on willingness to recommend is negatively affected by the education level MBO.

Managerials recommendations:

Ad campaigns (appeal to lifestyle)
There should be a couple of ad campaigns that are shown to different market segments, because different demographics are 
interested in different things. For example, for young adults/middle-aged people a campaign should rather be focused on trend fashion (new season fashion), 
functionality (appealing to fulfilling a purpose) and status (a garment representing a more prestigious lifestyle and exclusivity), rather than focusing 
only on sustainability as they scored lower on awareness and lower than average to willingness to buy sustainable clothes. In comparison to older people 
where taste (e.g. colour coordination, good silhouette fit or garment sets to mix and match) should be the main focus.
Budget should also be allocated to each campaign based on the highest revenue it would produce. This would mean high budget to women and people with high 
purchase frequency. Not all market segments need a campaign, a campaign based on education level is futile, only in moderation to status does education 
have a significant effect, but this does not suffice for marketing spending.

Retargeting ads (appeal to perception)
Target repeat purchasers as we have found that they have higher intention to buy again. Target everyone who has already ordered, but have different 
campaigns based on the loading scores and the model coefficient strengths, because an infrequent buyer who buys something based on need is less 
marketable to than someone who buys for pleasure or passion.

Word of mouth (high net promoter score)
In marketing consumers may ignore advertisements or not trust them, therefore budget should be allocated to improve customer relationships 
with people that may be willing to recommend your brand. We found these people to be the ones that enjoy a more luxurious and status based 
lifestyle typically in their 20’s as well as middle-aged consumers. People in their middle age probably have more money as well so we should appeal to them.
